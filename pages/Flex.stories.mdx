# Flex

The `Flex` component is analagous to `Box` but additionally sets the rendering context of its children to `display: flex`.

<!--
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic">
    <Flex as="aside" css={{ justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
      <Box css={{ bg: '$tonal200', p: '$2' }}>Hello from the left!</Box>
      <Box css={{ bg: '$tonal200', p: '$2' }}>Hello from the right!</Box>
    </Flex>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Flex} /> -->
