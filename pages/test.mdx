<!-- // import { Select } from '@atom-learning/components' -->

# MDX + Next.js

Look, a button! ðŸ‘‡

```jsx live
<Select options={[{ label: 'Hello', value: 'WHAT' }]} />
```

<PropsTable data={Select} />

<!--
The `Steps` component provides transitions between a series of views that form one multi-step process.

Its `render` prop is a function which takes a `props` argument and returns an array of React components, e.g.

```jsx
<Steps
  render={(props) => [
    () => <Step1 {...props} />,
    Step2,
    () => <Step3 {...props} />
  ]}
/>
```

The `props` argument is an object with the following properties:

- `currentIndex`: the array index of the current view
- `goToIndex`: a function which takes a `number` as its argument and sets the `index` to that number
- `goToNext`: a function which increments the index by 1
- `goToPrevious`: a function which decrements the index by 1

Whatever the change in `index`, the `Steps` component will animate the transition between views.

By passing these `props` to your individual view components, you can control the flow from one view to the next.
The simplest use cases will involve calling `next` after each step, while more complicated use cases will call `setIndex`
with values which depend on what happens in each view. E.g. for a login process, if the user selects a recently used login
in step 1, they would progress to enter their password. But if they chose "use another account" in step 1, they would progress
to enter a new username _then_ to the password step.

`background: papayawhip` is set on the `div` that _contains_ the `Steps` component, so the background
color remains visible during the transitions. --> -->
