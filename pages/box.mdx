# Box

The `Box` is our most fundamental container component. Many other components are composed of `Box`es. For example, this card:

`Box` falls back to rendering a `div`, but we can use it to render any other container element with e.g. `<Box as="section">`. In the card, `Box` is used to render a `section`,
`header`, `figure` and `footer`.

Avoid rendering any of these elements directly in our components â€” `Box` has all the same flexibility, but with the
addition of the powerful `css` prop and various styling utilities based on our themes.

```jsx live=true
<Box
  as="section"
  css={{
    bg: background,
    borderRadius,
    boxShadow: 'rgba(100, 100, 111, 0.2) 0px 7px 29px 0px',
    m: 'auto',
    p: '$3',
    textAlign: 'center',
    width: '250px'
  }}
>
  Some text in a Box
</Box>
```
